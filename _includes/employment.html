            I have completed my PhD study that focuses on the application of resonance testing 
            on asphalt concrete for evaluating thermally induced damage and healing. Developed a 
            non-contact resonance testing method for characterizing asphalt concrete under low temperature. 
            Applied theoretical and finite element modeling to support experimental results from the new testing method.</p>
